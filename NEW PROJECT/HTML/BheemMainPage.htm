                        Bheem is an adventurous and fun-loving 9-year-old boy who is gifted with extraordinary superhuman strength. This power is a boon for his village Dholakpur, which is constantly beset by all kinds of pens. Almost all the children of Dolakpur, a majority of the people, as well as Raja Indravarma himself, look up to Bheem for solutions to their problems, ranging from mysterious disappearances of some villagers and attacks by wild animals, to drought situations in the village. Bheem has a big heart and he always uses his strength to help those who are poor, wronged or needy, and may be considered a little guardian of the villagers and the animals in and around Dholakpur. Bheem is often seen defeating enemies who attack Dholakpur or harm the villagers, like the evil demon Kirmada, the robber Mangal Singh, and the evil witch. Through his valiant acts, Bheem has earned the trust of Dholakpur, and Raja Indravarma. Indravarma regards Bheem so highly that he often discusses major issues regarding the kingdom's welfare with him and his friends, and they are also sent to neighbouring kingdoms as Indravarma's emissaries. Bheem is often selected as Dholakpur's representative in many competitions, especially those regarding physical strength like wrestling, cycling, etc. Bheem loves food and has an insatiable appetite for laddus, which in fact, give him a surge of energy and make him even stronger than he normally is. These laddus are often stolen by Bheem from Tuntun's laddu shop, and are also offered by Tuntun's daughter Chutki, much to her mother's anger. This habit of stealing laddus is his only prominent fault. Bheem once even won a competition organised by Tuntun on who could eat the most laddus. He is also good at most sports, and is fairly intelligent. He is depicted as a fit boy, almost always wearing nothing but an orange dhoti (loose cloth worn around the groin).

                        The King of Dholakpur is King Indravarma. He is the father of Indumati. Though himself a valiant warrior, he mostly relies on Bheem for any crisis in the kingdom. He is also shown to be thoughtful on every occasion. He is a hockey player and also played an important role in a hockey match by making Bheem win. His enemy was King Chandravarma. He is 35 years old, according to the movie "Chhota Bheem: The Rise of Kirmada". He once was given a special diamond called Kohenoor from his ancestors. But he promised to give the diamond to three of Dholakpur's most notorious criminals, Shatadhanwa, Kritavarma, and Akrur. But he broke his promise. This made the three criminals very angry. Akrur and Kritavarma had sent Shatadhanwa to kill King Indravarma. While King Indravarma was sleeping, the wicked Shatadhanwa killed him and took away the Kohinoor diamond. But thanks to the Sanjeevani plant that belonged to a learned Brahman named Gargya, the king came back to life. After getting the Kohinoor diamond, the three crimanals became upset that the king was still alive. The guilty Shatadhanwa gave the diamond to Akrur and fled Dholakpur. But Bheem and his team caught Shatadhanwa while he was fleeing. They took him to the king. King indravarma had Shatadhanwa arrested for his crime. When Akrur and Kritavarma heard that Shatadhanwa was arrested, they both went into hiding. Kritavarma stayed in Dholakpur but he was living in the guise of a barber and became the king's royal barber. Akrur was living in the guise of a minister and became the king's prime minister.
